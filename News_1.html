        <h2>G2 and OGLU survive EMEA LCQ elimination bouts</h2>
        <p>G2 Esports and OG LDN UTD have survived the second round of elimination matches in the EMEA LCQ. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Both teams return to the server tomorrow for the third round of the lower bracket, while Natus Vincere and Guild Esports have been eliminated. Whoever wins that game will immediately play the lower bracket final.</p>
        <h3>Natus Vincere vs. G2 Esports (G2 2-0)</h3>
        
        <p>
            Despite having shared time in the VCT for most of 2022, NAVI and G2 never directly played each other and were always part of different groups. For their first match, G2 picked Bind into NAVI. It's one of the strongest maps for both teams, and it was one of the two G2 won against Acend in last Tuesday's elimination game.
            <br>
            <br>
            AvovA opened up the map with a stunner, chaining three triples for a 2-1 scoreline. While NAVI responded to take a 3-2 lead, G2 quickly got back into the game after a timeout. An ace from Mixwell propelled them into a 6-3 lead, and strong plays from 7ssk7 and zeddy gave NAVI two more rounds before the half ended 7-5.
            <br>
            <br>
            G2 couldn't extend their lead beyond 9-5 after switching sides, as a 3K from zeddy reeled them in to a 9-7 scoreline. G2 let slip a 1v2 from Cloud on their way to map point 12-8, but a timeout from NAVI yielded them two rounds by way of a 3K from Cloud. AvovA then closed out the map for G2 13-10, with a 3K on B putting an end to Bind.
            <br>
            <br>
            AvovA's strong start meant he had nine kills by the fourth round. Despite that, he was only able to find three more throughout that half, and eight more in the second half overall. Mixwell's Chamber stepped up with a more consistent performance, dropping 23 players for a 1.77 KD ratio.
            <br>
            <br>
            G2 totally shut NAVI down on Haven, the second map. The latter were only able to accrue three rounds on the map, leading to a destructive 13-3 scoreline to close out the match. Mixwell was G2's only player with a negative differential, but his 13 kills and 14 deaths were compensated by his 158 ADR and four entry kills on Neon, the most in the server.

            <br>
            <br>
            This loss eliminated NAVI from the tournament. They say goodbye to their dreams of making Champions. Their year may not yet be over, as the months following Champions will see European competition like Red Bull Home Ground #3.
